# MyTour
A GIS navigation software aimed towards tourists.


Designed a mapping GIS catered specifically towards tourists using data procured from OpenStreetMaps. Used the GTK graphics package to create an interactive UI. 
* The software visualizes the data very similar to how Google Maps displays streets, buildings, parks, and different natural features using parsed data. 
* The software allows the user to find the shortest route between two destinations using the A* algorithm. It also solves a variation of the travelling salesman problem where the software computes the best possible route. 
* Users can choose to load a map from a large list of cities. They could see different Points of Interest, Tourist and Leisure locations, and click to get information on them. 
* Users can interact (pan, zoom, highlight, search for locations, etc.) with the UI.
